# Recommendation System - Proof of Concept (POC)

## Overview
This project is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** implementation of a recommendation system designed for e-commerce platforms. The system processes large-scale user data efficiently and provides personalized product suggestions based on user preferences, browsing behavior, and purchase history. The key focus is to demonstrate the use of efficient data structures like **hash tables**, **graphs**, **heaps**, and **sparse matrices** for building a scalable and modular recommendation system.

## Features
1. **Hash Table (User Preferences)**:
   - Stores user profiles and preferences.
   - Allows constant-time retrieval of user-specific data.

2. **Graph (User-Item Interactions)**:
   - Represents relationships between users and products.
   - Supports traversal algorithms (e.g., DFS) for finding similar users or products.

3. **Heap (Top-k Recommendations)**:
   - Dynamically ranks and retrieves top-k recommended products.

4. **Sparse Matrix (User-Product Interactions)**:
   - Efficiently stores and processes sparse user-product interaction data.
   - Supports similarity computations for collaborative filtering.
